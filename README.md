## 🧩 About Me

I’m someone who enjoys **building systems, breaking them, and rebuilding them better**.

I don’t box myself into a single role.  
I like understanding **how things work end-to-end**: code, workflows, tooling, and the decisions behind them.

- 🌱 Learning by building, always  
- 🛠 Obsessed with processes and gradual optimization  
- 🧪 Currently working on something that *might turn out amazing*  
- 🧠 Motto: **Never stop learning or experiencing**
- 😄 Fun fact: I enjoy optimizing things that technically already work.

---

## 🧠 What I Care About

- Building things that evolve over time  
- Writing code that improves with context, not ego  
- Learning in public instead of pretending to know everything  
- Clean systems > clever hacks  
- Progress > perfection

---

## 🎯 Where I’m Headed

I’m transitioning toward **project and delivery-focused roles** where:

- Technical understanding improves planning and execution  
- Clear processes matter as much as clean code  
- Coordination, ownership, and follow-through drive impact  

---

Roles I’m interested in:
- Project Manager  
- Associate Project Manager  
- Project Coordinator  
- Technical Project / Program roles

---

## 🌍 Experience Snapshot

Since **2019**, I’ve been managing **people, processes, operations, and technology** for an NGO,
often wearing multiple hats while keeping systems running and improving over time.

## 🧠 Why a Coding Background Helps Me

I come from a coding-heavy academic background, which means:

- I can communicate clearly with developers  
- I understand trade-offs, timelines, and technical constraints  
- I ask better questions during planning and reviews  
- I focus on systems and delivery, not just tasks

I don’t manage *around* technology, I manage *with* it.

---

## 🧭 How I Work

- Start with clarity, not urgency  
- Break ambiguity into small, testable steps  
- Keep progress visible to everyone involved  
- Improve processes after understanding reality  
- Optimize only what actually matters

---

## 🛠 What I Do Well

- Turning vague ideas into executable plans  
- Coordinating people, processes, and timelines  
- Improving operations without overengineering  
- Keeping progress visible and teams aligned  
- Balancing speed with sustainability  
- Learning fast and adapting faster

---

## 🤝 Open To

- Entry to mid-level project management roles  
- Teams that value technical context in planning  
- Environments where learning and ownership matter  

If you’re building something complex and need structure, I can help.

## 🚧 Current Focus

```txt
→ Building quietly
→ Learning loudly
→ Improving systems step by step
```
