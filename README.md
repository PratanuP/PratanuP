## ◼ About Me

I’m someone who enjoys **building systems, breaking them, and rebuilding them better**.

I don’t box myself into a single role.  
I like understanding **how things work end-to-end**: code, workflows, tooling, and the decisions behind them.

- → Learning by building, always  
- → Obsessed with processes and gradual optimization  
- → Currently working on something that *might turn out amazing*  
- → Motto: **Never stop learning or experiencing**  
- → Fun fact: I enjoy optimizing things that technically already work  

---

## ◼ What I Care About

- Building things that evolve over time  
- Writing code that improves with context, not ego  
- Learning in public instead of pretending to know everything  
- Clean systems > clever hacks  
- Progress > perfection  

---

## ◼ Where I’m Headed

I’m transitioning toward **project and delivery-focused roles** where:

- Technical understanding improves planning and execution  
- Clear processes matter as much as clean code  
- Coordination, ownership, and follow-through drive impact  

**Roles I’m interested in**
- Project Manager  
- Associate Project Manager  
- Project Coordinator  
- Technical Project / Program roles

## ◼ Experience Snapshot

Since **2019**, I’ve been managing **people, processes, operations, and technology** for an NGO,  
often wearing multiple hats while keeping systems running and improving over time.

---

## ◼ Why a Coding Background Helps Me

I come from a coding-heavy academic background, which means:

- I communicate clearly with developers  
- I understand trade-offs, timelines, and technical constraints  
- I ask better questions during planning and reviews  
- I focus on systems and delivery, not just tasks  

I don’t manage *around* technology. I manage *with* it.

---

## ◼ How I Work

- Start with clarity, not urgency  
- Break ambiguity into small, testable steps  
- Keep progress visible to everyone involved  
- Improve processes after understanding reality  
- Optimize only what actually matters  

---

## ◼ What I Do Well

- Turning vague ideas into executable plans  
- Coordinating people, processes, and timelines  
- Improving operations without overengineering  
- Keeping progress visible and teams aligned  
- Balancing speed with sustainability  
- Learning fast and adapting faster

## ◼ Skill Stack (Curated & Practical)

**Project & Program Delivery**
- Agile methodology, planning, and scheduling  
- Documentation and workflow optimization  
- Stakeholder communication and coordination  
- Tools: Jira, Notion, ClickUp, MS Office, Google Workspace  

**Technical Foundation**
- Programming: Python, Java, JavaScript, SQL, C/C++  
- Web fundamentals: HTML, CSS  
- Comfortable reading, debugging, and reviewing code  
- Linux, IT troubleshooting, system support  

**Data, Analytics & Tooling**
- Tableau, Looker Studio, Excel  
- Google Analytics, basic data analysis  
- Using data to inform decisions and improve processes  

**Engineering Exposure**

- Docker, basic CI/CD (GitHub Actions)  

**Digital & Operational Tools**
- Google Ads, HubSpot, digital analytics  
- AI tools and prompt-based workflows for productivity  

*I don’t collect tools; I use them to improve delivery, clarity, and outcomes.*

## ◼ Open To

- Entry to mid-level project management roles  
- Teams that value technical context in planning  
- Environments where learning and ownership matter  

If you’re building something complex and need structure, I can help.
